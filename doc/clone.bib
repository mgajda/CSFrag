abstract ={Every year between 500 and 1000 peptide and protein structures are determined by NMR and deposited into the Protein Data Bank. However, the process of NMR structure determination continues to be a manually intensive and time-consuming task. One of the most tedious and error-prone aspects of this process involves the determination of torsion angle restraints including phi, psi, omega and chi angles. Most methods require many days of additional experiments, painstaking measurements or complex calculations. Here we wish to describe a web server, called PREDITOR, which greatly accelerates and simplifies this task. PREDITOR accepts sequence and/or chemical shift data as input and generates torsion angle predictions (with predicted errors) for phi, psi, omega and chi-1 angles. PREDITOR combines sequence alignment methods with advanced chemical shift analysis techniques to generate its torsion angle predictions. The method is fast (<40 s per protein) and accurate, with 88% of phi/psi predictions being within 30Â° of the correct values, 84% of chi-1 predictions being correct and 99.97% of omega angles being correct. PREDITOR is 35 times faster and up to 20% more accurate than any existing method. PREDITOR also provides accurate assessments of the torsion angle errors so that the torsion angle constraints can be readily fed into standard structure refinement programs, such as CNS, XPLOR, AMBER and CYANA. Other unique features to PREDITOR include dihedral angle prediction via PDB structure mapping, automated chemical shift re-referencing (to improve accuracy), prediction of proline cis/trans states and a simple user interface.

abstract ={SEQSEE (SEQuence SEEker) is a multi-purpose, menu-driven suite of programs designed to provide a fully integrated, state-of-the-art package for the analysis and display of protein sequences and protein databases. It is currently configured to run on most UNIX-based machines including Sun, SGI and NeXT workstations with conversion to other architectures (e.g. Vox or Cray) being a relatively simple task. SEQSEE is capable of performing nearly all of the analytical and comparative tasks found in most comprehensive commercially available software packages. These include sequence/database searching, sequence retrieval, sequence entry and editing, statistical sequence analysis, multiple sequence alignment, flexible pattern matching, and secondary structure prediction. SEQSEE also integrates a number of unique databases which allow it to perform many additional functions such as structure-based sequence alignments and homology-based secondary structure prediction. Additional enhancements to many previously published algorithms have substantially improved the performance of SEQSEE over that found for most other commercial products. The source code, the documentation and all of the required databases for SEQSEE are freely available and may be obtained by anonymous ftp.},
